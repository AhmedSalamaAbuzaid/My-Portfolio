# My-Portfolio

my portfolio most of the things that I have learned on this simple website,
I have used Vanilla javascript, CSS, and HTML.
also, I add some libraries like "A JavaScript Typing Animation Library",
AOS - Animate on scroll library,
font awesome, google font.

also, I have used API like Intersection Observer is a fantastic tool in JavaScript that allows you to quickly and efficiently

do pretty much anything based on the visibility of elements. This is perfect for scroll animations,

lazy loading images, infinite scroll, and much more. Also, Intersection Observer is incredibly performant and flexible, making it the best approach.
