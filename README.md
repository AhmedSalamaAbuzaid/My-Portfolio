# My-Portfolio

my portfolio most of the things that I have learned on this simple website,
I have used Vanilla javascript, CSS, and HTML.
also, I add some libraries like "A JavaScript Typing Animation Library",
AOS - Animate on scroll library,
font awesome, google font...

also, I have used API like Intersection Observer is a fantastic tool in JavaScript that allows you to quickly and efficiently.

do pretty much anything based on the visibility of elements. This is perfect for scroll animations,

lazy loading images, infinite scroll, and much more. Also, Intersection Observer is incredibly performant and flexible, making it the best approach.

with pure js i have made scrol to top button and 
the nav bar show when scroll to top and disappear when scroll to bottom .

also i have mad a setting tools box you can change the color of the page and save it in the local storage 
and you have full control in this setting box , you can control of random background images play or puase 

you can move very smothely by cliking on the quick nav bullets in the right of page as same as the navbar above.

dark mode button it automaticly saved in the local storage .
